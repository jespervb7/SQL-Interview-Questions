# A collection for my completed SQL interview questions

This repository contains a collection of completed interview questions. Alongside a few detailed statistics in each script!
The data collected in the csv files will eventually be used to display some information in a Power BI dashboard.

Majority of the questions will be done in T-SQL dialect, but you can find some MySQL, Postgres and some KQL

## The websites I use for practice questions

Below is a list of the websites I have found so far and use for practice questions. These are pretty well known websites and I highly encourage you to seek and try them out yourself!
You can also find links to my profiles, incase you want to verify I did the questions!
