## The question

Social Media Addiction can be a crippling disease affecting millions every year.

We need to identify people who may fall into that category.

Write a query to find the people who spent a higher than average amount of time on social media.

Provide just their first names alphabetically so we can reach out to them individually.

### Example data

#### Table user_time

| Field               | Data Type  |
|-------------------- |----------- |
| user_id             | int        |
| media_time_minutes  | int        |

#### Table users

| Field               | Data Type  |
|-------------------- |----------- |
| user_id             | int        |
| first_name          | text       |

### Example output

|first_name             |
|-------------------- |
|Adam          |
|Bella          |
|Chris          |
